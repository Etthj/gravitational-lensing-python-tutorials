# Gravitational Lensing Tutorials

![PyPi python support](https://img.shields.io/badge/Python-3.8-blue)

This repository provides tutorials for simulating strong gravitational lenses using two different methods. The tutorials cover the use of the Lenstronomy package and the codes provided by Massimo Meneghetti in his book entitled *Introduction to Gravitational Lensing, With Python Examples*. These tutorials aim to help researchers and enthusiasts to understand and simulate the phenomenon of strong gravitational lensing.
